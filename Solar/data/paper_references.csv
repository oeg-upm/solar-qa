Methane and methanol were the main reduction products. The yield of methane and methanol increases when modifying the TiO2 by silver incorporation is caused by two mechanisms: up to 5% of Ag in TiO2 the Ag impurity band inside the TiO2 bandgap decreases the absorption edge and increases so the electron\u2013hole pair generation, above 5% of Ag in TiO2 Ag metallic clusters are formed in TiO2 crystals with Shottky barrier at the metal\u2013semiconductor interface, which spatially separates electron and holes and increases their lifetime (decreases probability of their recombination).""","""K.

If this technique could be applied practically, a carbon circulation system would then be able to be constructed by reforming CO2 from combustion, using solar energy, to fuel, which would solve the problem of global warming and fossil fuels depletion all together. However, the technology is not yet practicable as the fuel concentration of products is too low. To increase the concentration and improve CO2 reforming performance on TiO2, a membrane reactor composed of TiO2 and gas separation membrane prepared by sol\u2013gel and dip-coating method has been built.

Consistent with CO2 adsorption and photodesorption on other n-type metal oxides such as ZrO2, the results suggest that the bent-CO2 species do not gain further charge from the TiO2 surface under illumination and are likely photodesorbed as neutral species. Additionally, although the formation of species such as CO and HCHO is thermodynamically possible, the energy needed to regenerate the oxygen vacancy on TiO2 surfaces (~7eV) is greater than that available through band-gap illumination (3.2eV). Therefore, CO2 reactions with water on irradiated anatase TiO2 surfaces are likely to be stoichiometric.""","""V.P. Indrakanti, J.D. Kubicki ,H.H.

The SPV response increased after surface noble metal (Pd and Ru) depositing and a new SPV response band appeared in the SPS curve of A and B in near IR, which was attributed to the surface state population transition formed by Pd deposition.

The nanostructured AgBr/TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared by the deposition-precipitation method in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Their photocatalytic activities were evaluated by the reduction yield in the presence of CO2 and water. The experiment results showed that 23.2% AgBr/TiO2 had relatively high reduction yields under visible-light irradiation for 5h, with a methane yield of 128.56, methanol yield of 77.87, ethanol yield of 13.28, and CO yield of 32.14&mu;molg&minus;1, respectively.

The NiO/TiO2 causes high visible-light activities for the degradations of 2-naphthol and p-cresol exceeding those of FeOx/TiO2 (Tada Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 3501&minus;3505). The main purpose of this study is to clarify the origin at an electronic level by the density functional simulation for NiO, Ni2O2, Ni3O3, and Ni4O4 clusters supported on TiO2 rutile (110) and anatase (001) surfaces. The clusters adsorb strongly on both rutile and anatase with adsorption energies ranging from &minus;3.18 to &minus;6.15 eV, creating new interfacial bonds between the clusters and both surfaces. On rutile, intermetallic Ni&ndash;Ti bonds facilitate stronger binding compared with anatase. The electronic structure shows that the top of the valence bands (VBs) of rutile and anatase arises from electronic states on the NiO cluster. On the other hand, the conduction band of rutile is from the Ti 3d states, whereas NiO cluster levels are generated near the conduction band minimum of anatase. This is in contrast to the SnO2/rutile TiO2 system, where the density of states near the conduction band minimum increases with the VB unmodified. In the NiO/TiO2 system, the band gaps of both rutile and anatase are narrowed by up to 0.8 eV compared with pristine TiO2, which pushes the photoactivity into the visible region. In view of the calculated electronic structure, we have attributed the enhanced photocataltyic activity both to the charge separation due to the excitation from the Ni 3d surface sub-band to the TiO2 conduction band and the action of the NiO species as a mediator for the electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to O2.""","""A.

The material properties and photocatalytic activities were compared with those prepared by a conventional wet-impregnation (WI) method. It was found that the samples prepared by the SP method had a larger specific surface area and a better dispersion of Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 than those prepared by the WI method, and as a result, the SP samples showed much higher photocatalytic activities toward H-2 production and CO2 reduction.

This study demonstrated the photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 by using a novel twin reactor to mimic photosynthesis process in nature. The twin reactor, which divided H2-generating photocatalyst and O2-generating photocatalyst in two compartments using a membrane, first achieved separate H2 and O2 evolution to prevent the backward reaction to form water under visible light irradiation. The generated hydrogen was then used to perform CO2 hydrogenation by CO2 reduction photocatalyst. The advantage is that CO2 hydrogenation is a spontaneous reaction based on the thermodynamics.

The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra show that a CO2 molecule adsorbed on MgO was activated to a CO2- radical under photoirradiation. In addition, it was confirmed by photoluminescence that new acceptor level built up between the valence band and the conduction band of MgO on CO2-adsorbed MgO. The CO2- radical was reduced to a surface bidentate formate or a surface bidentate acetate by H2 or CH4 in the dark, respectively. The surface bidentate formate anchors on MgO as a photoactive species and reduces CO2 in the gas phase to CO since the CO2 photocatalytic reduction proceeded over MgO absorbing HCHO or CH3CHO and only 12CO was formed in the presence of 12CO2 over MgO modified by a 13C-labeled formate under irradiation. The active species was generated from the side-on adsorption-type bidentate carbonate selectively, although the two types of bidentate carbonates were detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. On the other hand, the role of the surface bidentate acetate is under discussion.

TEM results show that silver is well dispersed as small nanoparticles (2-3 nm) on Ag/TiO2 samples, while it forms larger crystallites (150-300 nm) on Ag/ZnO catalysts.

Regarding the photocatalytic activity, both semiconductors (TiO2 and ZnO) are active towards CO2 photoreduction although titania-based catalysts show higher performances.

In particular, Zn2GeO4ZIF-8 hybrid nanorods were successfully synthesized by growing ZIF-8 nanoparticles on Zn2GeO4 nanorods.

The 3DOM TiO2 support was prepared using a colloidal crystal template (CCT) method. A series of photocatalysts of TiO2-supported Au nanoparticles with uniform sizes were successfully synthesized by the facile method of gas bubbling-assisted membrane reduction (GBMR). These photocatalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis of nitrogen adsorption isotherm, photoluminescence spectra (PL), and the surface photovoltage (SPV) technique. All the catalysts possess well-defi{ligature}ned 3DOM structures, which are highly ordered and interconnected with one another by small pore windows, and the Au nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed and supported on the inner wall of the uniform macropores. The slow light effect of the 3DOM structure can enhance absorption efficiency of solar irradiation. And the introduction of Au nanoparticles can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible region owing to Au surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and it is favorable for enhancing the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. 3DOM AuTiO2 photocatalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4 under visible illumination.""","""J.

This article focuses on the effects of cocatalysts and reaction modes on photocatalytic behaviors of TiO2 with an emphasis on the selectivity of photogenerated electrons for CO2 reduction in the presence of H2O, which has been overlooked in most of the published papers. Our results clarified that the reaction using H2O vapor exhibited significantly higher selectivity for CO2 reduction than that by immersing the photocatalyst into liquid H2O. We examined the effect of noble metal cocatalysts and found that the rate of CH4 formation increased in the sequence of Ag < Rh < Au < Pd < Pt, corresponding well to the increase in the efficiency of electron-hole separation. This indicates that Pt is the most effective cocatalyst to extract photogenerated electrons for CO2 reduction. The selectivity of CH4 in CO2 reduction was also enhanced by Pt. The size and loading amount of Pt affected the activity; a smaller mean size of Pt particles and an appropriate loading amount favored the formation of reduction products. The reduction of H2O to H2 was accelerated more than the reduction of CO2 in the presence of Pt, leading to a lower selectivity for CO2 reduction and limited increases in CH4 formation rate. We demonstrated that the addition of MgO into the Pt-TiO2 catalyst could further enhance the formation of CH4. The formation of H2 was suppressed simultaneously, suggesting the increase in the selectivity for CO2 reduction in the presence of MgO. Furthermore, the MgO- and Pt-modified TiO2 catalyst exhibited a higher CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction.""","""S. Xie, Y. Wang, Q. Zhang , W. Deng, Y.

H-TiO2 nanoparticles with different hydrogenation degrees are rapidly synthesized through H2 plasma treatment in several minutes; and their photocatalytic activities are evaluated by methylene blue (MB) degradation and CO2 reduction in aqueous and gaseous media, respectively.

Further investigations reveal that the higher ratio of trapped holes (O- centers) and a lower recombination rate induced by the increase of surface defects might be the critical factors for the high activity of s-H-TiO2; in contrast, h-H-TiO2 nanoparticles possess high concentration of bulk defects, leading to a significantly decreased amount of O- centers and enhanced non-radiative recombination, which strongly inhibit their photoactivity.

Photocatalysts were comprehensively characterized using nitrogen physisorption, XRD, XPS, contact potential difference measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and DR UV-vis spectroscopy and their performance was explored in the CO2 photocatalytic reduction for the first time. Concerning photocatalysts properties, it was revealed that the inhibiting effect of cerium on the TiO2 crystallites growth occurred only up to 3mol.% of Ce when the incorporation of Ce4+ into the anatase lattice took place. This phenomenon was correlated with the expansion of anatase cell volume. At higher Ce loadings (?5mol.%) the anatase lattice was saturated and the formationseparation of amorphous ceria andor ceria (~1nm) nucleation occurred, accompanied by the increase of TiO2 anatase crystallite-size and the limitation of value of anatase cell volume. Further, it was found out that the mesoporosity of photocatalysts may be preferentially attributed to voids existing between the individual crystallites and thus can be influenced by changes in the crystallite size. The modification of TiO2 with cerium affected also the spectral response of photocatalysts, shifting it to the visible light region. However, this property itself was not crucial in the CO2 photocatalytic reduction. The key role in the CO2 photocatalytic reduction played the energies of electrons and holes within the electronic structure of photocatalysts, which were markedly affected by the Ce atoms addition.

The results showed that CO2 absorbed in cyclohexanol was reduced to cyclohexyl formate (CF) on conduction band and the absorbent cyclohexanol was oxidized to cyclohexanone (CH) on valance band of the photocatalyst. It was revealed that the highest formation rates of 20.2 ?mol(gcat h) and 20.0 ?mol(g cat h) for CF and CH could be obtained when TiO2CdS with the molar ratio of 8 was used.

The metal doping influenced strongly the crystal structure as well as the photocatalytic activity of the oxides. The XRD data could prove that the Mo(V) doping induces the orthorhombic phase, while the Cr(III) doping favors the triclinic phase for both oxides. Metal doping also modified the photosensitivity of the oxides, extending the absorption toward the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity in water splitting under visible light irradiation was evaluated by monitoring the H2, CO2 and CO evolution. The results showed that Cr(III)-doped BiTaO4 and BiNbO4, in general, are more selective for hydrogen production, while Mo(V)-doped materials are more selective for CO2 generation. Comparing the photocatalytic activity of BiTaO4 and BiNbO 4, the former shows higher activity for hydrogen production as well as for CO2 generation, specially when the concentration was 2% in Cr(III) and Mo(V), respectively. Those results are in agreement with the computational study to access the effect of doping on the electronic structure.

The MgO\u2013TiO2 microspheres were fabricated by two methods: (1) a one-step spray pyrolysis method using TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles dispersed in Mg(NO3)2 solution as the precursors (Mg\/Ti-SP), and (2) spray pyrolysis synthesis of pure TiO2 (P25) microspheres first and then wet-impregnation with MgO (Mg\/Ti-WI).

For Mg\/Ti-SP, the strong aggregation of MgO nanoparticles caused a rough surface of the MgO\u2013TiO2 microsphere; while for Mg\/Ti-WI, MgO was more uniformly deposited leading to a much smoother surface of the microsphere. The surface dispersion of MgO was found to significantly affect the performance of MgO\u2013TiO2 in CO2 photoreduction. At the same MgO concentration, Mg\/Ti-SP had more than two times higher activity than Mg\/Ti-WI, and most importantly, little deactivation of the catalyst was observed on Mg\/Ti-SP while Mg\/Ti-WI started to deactivate after 1 to 2 h when the reactor was operating in a continuous flow mode. The ease of photo-induced electron transfer to the catalyst surface may have contributed to the superb activity of Mg\/Ti-SP samples.

This strategy advantageously inherits both the traditional hard-templating technique for well-defined 3D predesigned macroporous architecture and soft-templating techniques for interpore connectivity. The resulting TiO2 sponge exhibits about a 2.60 fold improvement in CO2 photoconversion rate (CH4: 5.13 ppm h-1) compared to the referred TiO2 (1.97 ppm h-1) formed in the absence of the LRS. The generation rate of CH4 over macromesoporous TiO2 sponge could be further significantly enhanced to 11.95 ppm h-1 by co-loading Pt (0.9 wt%) and Cu (1.7 wt%) as co-catalysts by improvement of the separations of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The higher photocatalytic activity of the macromesoporous TiO2 sponge can be attributed to the following three reasons: (1) macroporous architecture favors gas diffusion of the reactants and the products; (2) macroporous architecture also promotes the multiple-reflection effect occurring inside the interior macrocavities, which enables trapping (or harvest) the incident light in the photocatalyst for a longer duration and bring forth more opportunities for light absorption; and (3) the mesoporous structure enhances gas captureadsorption of the reactants and provides more reaction sites.""","""F.

Furthermore, by comparing different halide ions, the photoactivity of 30AgBrpCN was higher (by a factor of 1.3) than that of the optimal 30AgClpCN. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was accredited to (1) the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect from Ag and (2) the formation of heterojunction structure between pCN and AgBr in the AgBrpCN hybrid photocatalysts for efficient charge transfer and separation to retard the recombination process as evidenced by the photoluminescence analysis. The effective charge separation was attributed to the matching of electronic band potentials of pCN and AgBr, exhibiting the Type II heterojunction, in comparison to that of AgClpCN (Type I heterojunction).

The photocatalytic performances of all samples were evaluated through the photoreduction of CO2 under the irradiation of low-power energy-saving daylight bulbs. Pure oxygen-rich TiO2 (O2-TiO2) was first prepared via a simple aqueous peroxo-titanate route. The as-prepared photocatalyst was shown to exhibit reduced band gap energy and visible-light-active characteristics. However, the photoactivity of bare O<inf>2<inf>-TiO<inf>2<inf> was found to gradually deteriorate over time.

The results show that in situ Cu deposition leads to in situ formation of abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) on the surface of the TiO2 nanosheets. Interestingly, the co-existence of Vo and Cu2O clusters could promote the photoactivity of CO2 reduction efficiently. The surface Vo play a significant role in the reduction of CO2. Meanwhile, the deposited Cu(i) species serve also as active sites for the formation of CH4, and then protect CH4 from degradation by generated oxidation species.

Cu-TiO2-1.0 shows the highest photocatalytic activity, which is over 30 times higher than that of the parent TiO2. This great enhancement of photocatalytic activity may be contributed by high CO2 adsorption capacity, high electron mobility, and high concentration of Vo.

However, regeneration of the oxygen vacancies in photocatalysts is still a problem since an oxygen vacancy will be filled up by the O atom from CO2 after the dissociation process. Herein, we have fabricated highly efficient BiOCl nanoplates with photoinduced oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies were easily regenerated by light irradiation due to the high oxygen atom density and low Bi-O bond energy even when the oxygen vacancies had been filled up by the O atom in the photocatalytic reactions. These oxygen vacancies not only enhanced the trapping capability for CO2, but also enhanced the efficiency of separation of electron-hole pairs, which resulted in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction under simulated solar light. Furthermore, the generation and recovery of the defects in the BiOCl could be realized during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in water.

The reactor design and sample pretreatment excludes product formation from intermediates. Apart from CO2, the only other reactant offered to the catalyst is water. The main products found on this prominent photocatalyst are methane and carbon monoxide. To distinguish between the three possible mechanisms reported in previous studies, likely intermediates of the reaction were added to the TiO2 photocatalyst and their reactivity was followed by gas chromatographic analysis. Based on the results, we can clearly rule out CO as intermediate of any photocatalytic reaction pathway on TiO2, because CO was not converted at all within a course of six hours. An improvement of carbonate formation on TiO2 brought about by surface-doping with sodium decreased product yields, so carbonates are unlikely intermediates as well. Methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid were exclusively oxidized back to CO2. We thus support a mechanism running over C2-intermediates, and we tested our hypothesis by reacting glyoxal, glyoxylic acid, acetic acid and acetaldehyde on TiO2. The reactions of acetaldehyde and acetic acid led to product distributions very similar to those obtained from CO2 under the standard reaction conditions, strongly supporting the C2 mechanism.

Results show the as-prepared SnNb2O6 samples with typical 2D nanosheet in the thickness of about 1 nm. Owing to the unique features of the nanosheets, the surface area, photoelectrical property and the surface basicity of SnNb2O6 are greatly improved compared with the counterpart prepared by traditional solid state reaction. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of CO2 on SnNb2O6 nanosheets is much higher than that of layered SnNb2O6. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of SnNb2O6 nanosheets for the reduction of CO2 is about 45 and 4 times higher than those of the references (layered SnNb2O6 and common N-doped TiO2), respectively. To understand the interaction between the CO2 molecule and the surface of photocatalyst, and the reactive species in the reduction process, the intermediates have also been detected by in situ FTIR with and without visible light irradiation.

A detailed investigation of 2-propanol oxidation as a model reaction revealed significant differences between the reactivities of the WO3 and TiO2 systems. On TiO2 photocatalysts, complete decomposition to CO2 proceeded readily, due to the occurrence of direct oxidation of 2-propanol and acetone adsorbed by holes, resulting in significantly low selectivity for partial oxidation. On the other hand, the rates of acetone peroxidation on WO3 photocatalysts were much lower than those on TiO2 due to the low affinity of the WO3 surface to the substrates, particularly acetone. The low affinity of the WO3 surface also enables preferential generation of hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) from water, which react with 2-propanol much more efficiently than with acetone, further increasing selectivity for acetone in the WO3 system. Most importantly, the loading of a palladium oxide cocatalyst on WO3 drastically improved the selectivity for acetone by almost completely suppressing the peroxidation of acetone during photoirradiation. A considerable amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was confirmed to accumulate during photoirradiation on PdOx\/WO3 due to the high selectivity of the PdOx cocatalyst for the two-electron reduction of O2 molecules, while such accumulation was not observed for Pt\/WO3. The H2O2 in the PdOx\/WO3 system preferentially reacted with photogenerated holes when the concentrations of acetone and H2O2 increased, suppressing the peroxidation of acetone by the holes.

The results show that as compared to bare TiO2, TiO2@SiO2 composites exhibit significantly enhanced adsorption capacity of CO2 and facilitated photogenerated charge carriers separation, and thereby enhanced photoactivity toward CO2 reduction. Although the insulating nature of SiO2 inhibits the charge injection from inner TiO2 core through the silica layer to the outer surface, the separation efficiency of charge carriers within the inner pore structure of TiO2@SiO2 is facilitated due to the as-formed Ti-O-Si bonds. In particular, TiO2@30%SiO2, which balances the combined influence of the CO2 adsorption and charge carriers separation, acquires the best photoactivity and the high selectivity for CO formation.

We experimentally found that CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of pCN using electron microscopy analysis. The CND\/pCN-3 sample with a CND content of 3 wt.% showed the highest catalytic activity in the CO2 photoreduction process under visible and simulated solar light. This process results in the evolution of CH4 and CO. The total amounts of CH4 and CO generated by the CND\/pCN-3 photocatalyst after 10 h of visible-light activity were found to be 29.23 and 58.82 \u03bcmol\u00b7gcatalyst \u22121, respectively. These values were 3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than the amounts generated when using pCN alone. The corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated to be 0.076%. Furthermore, the CND\/pCN-3 sample demonstrated high stability and durability after four consecutive photoreaction cycles, with no significant decrease in the catalytic activity. The significant improvement in the photoactivity using CND\/pCN-3 was attributed to the synergistic interaction between pCN and CNDs. This synergy allows the effective migration of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via wellcontacted heterojunction interfaces, which retards the charge recombination. This was confirmed by photoelectrochemical measurements, and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence analyses. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were consistent with our experimental\\r\\nresults, and showed that the work function of CNDs (5.56 eV) was larger than that of pCN (4.66 eV). This suggests that the efficient shuttling of electrons from the conduction band of pCN to CNDs hampers the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs. This significantly increased the probability of free charge carriers reducing CO2 to CH4 and CO. Overall, this study underlines the importance of understanding the charge carrier dynamics of the CND\/pCN hybrid nanocomposites, in order to enhance solar energy conversion.""","""W. J. Ong,L. K.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into solar fuels has been regarded as an ideal solution to reduce CO2 emissions and to use solar energy. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is one of the most promising visible-light-driven photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Unfortunately, the CO2 reduction performance of g-C3N4 based photocatalyst is normally limited by the inferior charge separation ability and limited CO2 adsorption capacity. In this study, two cooperative strategies, that is, combined host nanostructural design and surface guest grafting, are adopted to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. Specifically, holey graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanotubes were firstly fabricated to modify the light-harvesting ability, the redox potential as well as the charge separation efficiency. And then, the as-prepared tubular g-C3N4 was decorated with suitable amount of transparent zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoclusters to further increase CO2 capture capacity without sacrifice of light absorption capacity. Because of the cooperative effects of nanostructural design and surface grafting, the optimized ZIF-8 modified tubular g-C3N4 photocatalysts exhibit a great enhancement in photocatalytic CH3OH production efficiency by more than 3 times, relative to the bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) photocatalyst synthesized by conventional pyrolysis of melamine.

However, there still lacks fundamental understanding of the role of the vacancies in semiconductor materials. Herein, the g-C3N4 nanosheets with tunable nitrogen vacancies are prepared as the photocatalysts for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction to CO. On the basis of both experimental investigation and DFT calculations, nitrogen vacancies in g-C3N4 induce the formation of midgap states under the conduction band edge. The position of midgap states becomes deeper with the increasing of nitrogen vacancies. The g-C3N4 nanosheets with the optimized density of nitrogen vacancies display about 18 times and 4 times enhancement for H2 evolution and of CO2 reduction to CO, respectively, as compared to the bulk g-C3N4. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of several factors including (1) nitrogen vacancies cause the excitation of electrons to midgap states below the conduction band edge, which results in extension of the visible light absorption to photons of longer wavelengths (up to 598 nm); (2) the suitable midgap states could trap photogenerated electrons to minimize the recombination loss of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs; and (3) nitrogen vacancies lead to uniformly anchored small Pt nanoparticles (1\u20132 nm) on g-C3N4, and facilitate the electron transfer to Pt. However, the overintroduction of nitrogen vacancies generates deeper midgap states as the recombination centers, which results in deterioration of photocatalytic activities.

The optimized CdIn2S4\/mpg-C3N4photocatalyst exhibited a high CH3OH-production rate of 42.7 \u0002mol g\u22121h\u22121at a mpg-C3N4content of 20 wt%. This rate was 1.8 times higherthan that of pure CdIn2S4. The significant enhancement of photocatalystic activity was mainly ascribedto the increased CO2adsorption capacity and the improved separation and transfer of photogeneratedelectron-hole pairs at the intimate interface of CdIn2S4\/mpg-C3N4heterojunctions. Furthermore, thehybrid photocatalysts displayed excellent stability under visible-light. A possible mechanism of enhancedphotocatalytic activity of CdIn2S4\/mpg-C3N4composite on photocatalytic reduction of CO2was also pro-posed.

Here we report a new approach for the synthesis of reduced TiO2 with {001} facets exposed via a hydrothermal process. By the introduction of fluoride atoms, {001} and {101} facets are formed, which act as hole and electron collectors, respectively, for charge separation. By adjusting the volume of HF added, a rutile\u2013anatase transition is observed for the first time. EPR spectra confirm the generation of Ti3+ species in the bulk of TiO2, and Ti3+ signals are studied in the anatase and rutile phases separately. The quantified EPR shows that reduced TiO2 samples present 14\u2006000-fold more spins compared to the pristine TiO2, and the intensity can reach as high as 24.6 \u00d7 1019 spins per g. The obtained samples also have a unique disordered layer with a thickness of 1\u20132 nm on their surfaces, which contributes to the stabilization of the formed Ti3+ species by preventing their oxidation in air. In addition, the synthesized reduced TiO2 samples also exhibit wide-spectrum solar light absorption, especially in the near-infrared region.

Building heterojunctions can enhance photocatalysts performance, by facilitating charge transfer between two heterojunction phases. The material parameters that control this charge transfer remain unclear. Here, it is hypothesized that governing factors for CO2 photoreduction in gas phase are: i) a large porosity to accumulate CO2 molecules close to catalytic sites and ii) a high number of \u201cpoints of contact\u201d between the heterojunction components to enhance charge transfer. The former requirement can be met by using porous materials; the latter requirement by controlling the morphology of the heterojunction components. Hence, composites of titanium oxide or titanate and metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), a highly porous material, are built. TiO2 or titanate nanofibers are synthesized and MOF particles are grown on the fibers. All composites produce CO under UV\u2013vis light, using H2 as reducing agent. They are more active than their component materials, e.g., \u22489 times more active than titanate. The controlled composites morphology is confirmed and transient absorption spectroscopy highlights charge transfer between the composite components.

The remarkable photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the unique 2D\/2D\/2D architecture that creates large interfacial contact between the constituent materials for rapid charge transfer, to hinder the direct recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. Notably, RGO played two significant roles: as a supporter to capture the electrons from CN, and as a redox mediator to promote the Z-scheme charge transfer between CN and BWO. The result is a greater extent of charge separation in the present BWO\/RGO\/CN heterojunction system, as evidenced by the photoluminescence, photocurrent responses, and electron microscopy findings.

It was found that the hcp Ru achieved higher average CO and CH4 production rate but lower H2 production rate in comparison with fcc Ru. As revealed by the experimental characterizations combined with theory simulations, the phase-dependent photocatalytic performance is resulted from the different surface reaction behaviors on the fcc and hcp Ru cocatalysts. The adsorption energy of CO2 molecules on the dominated (101\u00af1) face of hcp Ru is higher than that on the dominated (111) face of fcc Ru. As a result, the stronger interaction between CO2 molecules and the surface of hcp Ru contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic activity and selectivity of C3N4-hcp Ru in reduction of CO2.

Because CO2 reduction is an uphill process with a large energy barrier, suitable catalysts are necessary to achieve this transformation. In addition, CO2 adsorption on a catalyst and proton transfer to CO2 are two important factors for the conversion reaction, and catalysts with high surface area and more active sites are required to improve the efficiency of CO2 reduction.

However, it is difficult to understand why the yield of CO\u2014the other product of photocatalytic CO2 reduction\u2014is decreased only in terms of photoinduced electron lifetime. In this work, the mechanism of Pt-promoted CH4 formation was probed again in a gas-solid system of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over highly-dispersed-Pt decorated In2O3 nanorods (Pt\/In2O3). It was found that the presence of Pt modulates the surface property of In2O3 due to electronic and steric effect, resulting in a loss of HCO3\u207b, b-CO3\u00b2\u207b and m-CO3\u00b2\u207b species for the coadsorption of CO2 with H2O. However, this is not directly related with the high CH4 selectivity and low CO yield on the Pt\/In2O3 photocatalysts. Photocatalytic reductions of CO, HCOOH, CH2O, and CH3OH as well as photocatalytic CO2 reduction over photocatalysts with different H2 uptakes confirm that H adatoms derived from H2 or H2O dissociation on Pt play a key role in the formation of CH4. Low H2 dissociation barrier on Pt and weak H\u2013Pt bond facilitate the bonding of C in CO2 with H, thus restraining CO production. In other words, the metallic Pt acts as atomic hydrogen reservoir that supplies sufficient and readily available protons for CH4 formation over Pt-decorated semiconductors.

To break through this limitation, we designed an ultrathin intermediate-band semiconductor, and hence first realized IR-driven CO2 overall splitting on a single material without using any sacrificial reductants. Taking the synthetic ultrathin cubic-WO3 layers as an example, theoretical calculations disclose that the created oxygen vacancies reaching a critical density results in an intermediate band, verified by synchrotron-radiation valence-band spectra, photoluminescence spectra, UV-vis-NIR spectra, and synchrotron-radiation IR reflectance spectra. As a result, the oxygen-deficient WO3 atomic layers display IR-driven CO2 overall splitting to CO and O2, while their catalytic activity proceeds without deactivation even after 3 days. Also, the higher oxygen vacancy concentration favors CO2 adsorption and activation into COOH* radical, affirmed by CO2 temperature-programmed desorption spectra and in situ FTIR spectra, hence guaranteeing increased CO and O2 formation rates.""","""L.

Cobalt (Co) is then deliberately doped in BiVO4 atomic layers to adjust the electronic structures. XPS analysis, CO2 TPD and electrochemical experiments indicate that Co doping makes the electron densities around O anions increase, which could likely facilitate CO2 activation and electron transfer to CO2 molecules, while photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic oxygen evolution experiments demonstrate that Co doping could also promote water oxidation reactions. Further investigations by density functional theory calculation reveal that Co doping results in the generation of new defect levels above the Fermi level, inferring that a higher hole concentration is favorable for water oxidation, and the doped Co 3d orbits located at the top of valence bands might serve as active centers for water oxidation. As a result, Co-doped BiVO4 atomic layers achieve an efficient and stable CH4 production rate of 23.8 \u03bcmol g\u22121 h\u22121 under atmospheric CO2 concentration (400 ppm), which is about three times the activity of pristine BiVO4 atomic layers.

The results of the characterization showed that C and O are successfully integrated into the framework of g-CN. The O-containing and C-containing section of the as-prepared catalysts (OCCNx) play the role of donor and acceptor, respectively. The donor-acceptor systems of OCCNx offer an extra electron transfer transition mode, which dramatically extends the optical absorption range, and narrows down the bandgap of g-CN from 2.74 to 2.03\u202feV.

In this study, we restudy Pt\/TiO2 for the thermally assisted photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and reveal a different story between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis. For example, when using disordered Pt\/TiO2\u2212x, the CO2 conversion via photocatalysis at 298 K is not impressive. However, when the system temperature is increased to 393 K, the CO2 conversion rate is significantly enhanced by a factor of 155 as compared to that obtainable from pristine TiO2; further, surprisingly high selectivity of CH4 (87.5%) could be achieved. Thermally coupled photocatalysis yields the enhanced evolution of H2 side products over Pt (4.06 nm)\/TiO2 and promoted H2 splitting over Pt (2.33 nm)\/TiO2, which is seldom observed in conventional Pt\/TiO2 photocatalysis. The synergy of improved charge separation at the Pt\/TiO2\u2212x interface induced by surface disordering and accelerated H2 consumption near smaller Pt nanoparticles by thermal assistance are believed to be critically important for the simultaneous enhancement of CO2 conversion rates and CH4 product selectivity.

Also, this process would help to reduce the CO2 concentration to mitigate the global temperature and could partly fulfill energy demands. To achieve this, Cu2O photocatalyst represents an excellent option to convert the CO2 molecule into solar fuels. However, its capacity to adsorb CO2 is limited. Thus, it is necessary to support the photocatalyst in materials that provided strong basic active sites to adsorb CO2 spontaneously. In this case, dolomite is an earth-abundant material that contains alternating planes of Ca2+ and Mg2+ with the potential to be used as photocatalyst-support. Herein, for the first time, Cu2O was supported on an activated-dolomite via a microwave-hydrothermal method. The resulting materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, PL, FTIR, DRS, N2 physisorption, and Raman spectroscopy. Cu2O supported on activated-dolomite (Cu\/DA) was evaluated in the photocatalytic CO2 conversion to solar fuels (CH3OH and HCOH) under LED-visible light, and its capacity to adsorb CO2 was evidenced by gas chromatography. The dolomite-activated sample (DA) exhibited high surface area (125 m2 g\u22121), low spherical and homogeneous particle size (200 nm), and small pore diameter (<2 nm), which contribute to a high amount of CO2 adsorbed (180 mgCO2 g\u22121).

The yields of HCOOH and O2 meet almost stoichiometric ratio and are as high as 896.7 and 440.7\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009g\u22121\u2009h\u22121, respectively. The high efficiencies of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation in the artificial system are attributed to both the direct Z-scheme electronic structure of Cu2O-Pt\/SiC\/IrOx and the indirect Z-scheme spatially separated reduction and oxidation units, which greatly prolong lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes and prevent the backward reaction of products.

However, the efficiency of this technology is unavoidably hampered by the ineffective generation and utilization of photoinduced charge carriers. In this contribution, we report a facile in situ topotactic transformation approach where {001}-faceted BiOBr nanosheets (BOB-NS) were employed as the starting material for the formation of single-crystalline ultrathin Bi2WO6 nanosheets (BWO-NS). The as-obtained BWO-NS not only preserved the advantageous properties of the 2D nanostructure and predominantly exposed {001} facets but also possessed enlarged specific surface areas as a result of sample thickness reduction. As opposed to the commonly observed bandgap broadening when the particle sizes decrease to an ultrathin nanoscale owing to the quantum size effect, the developed BWO-NS exhibited a fascinating bandgap narrowing compared to those of pristine Bi2WO6 nanoplates (BWO-P) synthesized from a conventional one-step hydrothermal approach. Moreover, the electronic band positions of BWO-NS were modulated as a result of ion exchange for the reconstruction of the energy bands, where BWO-NS demonstrated significant upshifting of CB and VB levels; these are beneficial for photocatalytic reduction applications. This propitious design of BWO-NS through integrating the merits of BOB-NS caused BWO-NS to exhibit substantial 2.6 and 9.3-fold enhancements of CH4 production over BOB-NS and BWO-P, respectively.""","""Xin Ying Kong, Tong Tong, Boon-Junn Ng, Jingxiang Low, Tingying Helen Zeng, Abdul Rahman Mohamed, Jiaguo Yu, Siang-Piao Chai""",12,chai.siang.piao@monash.edu,"""CN""",

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra and the experimental measured Fermi level (EF) indicate that electrons transfer from PGCN to BOC, which leads to the formation of the built-in electric field with the orientation from PGCN to BOC. Driven by the built-in electric field, the charge carriers transfer through a step-like pathway. This step-scheme porous g-C3N4\/Bi12O17Cl2 (PGCN\/BOC) heterostructured nanocomposite displays an enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with pure BOC and PGCN.

Herein, a step-by-step route is reported for the in situ growth of island-shaped graphene on TaON particles (TaON@G) with controllable distribution, targeting a superior photocatalyst for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. The TaON@G photocatalyst possesses the snug contact interface with suitable interfacial energy levels for accelerating the charge separation, the island-shaped graphene with a hollow nanoarchitecture for facilitating the adsorption of CO2, and the hierarchical structure with spatially separated active sites for activating CO2 and promoting proton release. The optimized TaON@G achieves a visible-light-driven CO2-to-CH4 yield of 1.61 \u03bcmol g\u22121 h\u22121, which is nearly 13-fold higher compared with that of pristine TaON and outperforms most Ta-based (oxy)nitride catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further elucidate the enhanced activity, suggesting that TaON interacts with graphene strongly with the charge transfer from TaON to graphene, inducing electron-rich graphene with a significant upshift of the graphene Fermi level, leading to a high filling fraction of the antibonding orbitals, thereby weakening the C\ue0c8O bond of the adsorbed CO2 for breaking.

Even though the intrinsic physical properties of perovskite QDs have been significantly improved, the chemical stability of these materials remains questionable. Their low long-term chemical stability limits their commercial applicability in photocatalysis. In this study, we investigated the photodegradation mechanisms of perovskite QDs and their hybrids via photoluminescence (PL) by varying the excitation power and the ultraviolet (UV) exposure power. Defects in perovskite QDs and the interface between the perovskite QD and the co-catalyst influence the photo-stability of perovskite QDs. Consequently, we designed a stable perovskite QD film via an in-situ cross-linking reaction with amine-based silane materials. The surface ligand comprising 2,6-bis(N-pyrazolyl)pyridine nickel(II) bromide (Ni(ppy)) and 5-hexynoic acid improved the interface between the Ni co-catalyst and the perovskite QD. Then, ultrathin SiO2 was fabricated using 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES) to harness the strong surface binding energy of the amine functional group of APTES with the perovskite QDs. The Ni co-catalyst content was further increased through Ni doping during purification using a short surface ligand (3-butynoic acid). As a result, stable perovskite QDs with rapid charge separation were successfully fabricated. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) PL study demonstrated that the modified perovskite QD film exhibited slow photodegradation owing to defect passivation and the enhanced interface between the Ni co-catalyst and the perovskite QD. This interface impeded the generation of hot carriers, which are a critical factor in photodegradation.

Uniform ligand-free metal nanoparticles (NPs) of Ag, Cu, Au, Pd, and Pt, supported on TiO2, are active for CO2 photoreduction using water as an electron donor.

The activity of these photocatalysts can be enhanced by varying the surface basicity of TiO2 with primary amines.

Systematic investigation of Co\/g-C3N4 SACs formation process disclosed that concentrated-H2SO4 exfoliation of g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) as the substrate followed by a two-step calcination process is essential to achieve ultrahigh metal loading.

The nitric acid plays three roles in the synthetic process: providing protonation sources for the p-C3N4, assisting the growth of InVO4 nanobelts on p-C3N4, and facilitating the formation of Vo in InVO4. Intriguingly, the Vo content is tuned by varying the amount of C3N4 which reduces free H+ concentration and increases the electron density around V in VO43-, leading to a tade-off effect on Vo formation and thus a volcano-shaped evolution profile of Vo content. The introduction of Vo reduces the band gap of InVO4 and enhances the n-type conductivity, expediting the interfacial charge transfer in terms of the S-scheme pathway. Besides, the protonation of C3N4 improves electrical conductivity, promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules, and thermodynamically favours the conversion to CO.

To determine the elusive reaction mechanism, we report an interconnected strategy combining in-situ spectroscopies, theoretical studies and catalytic experiments. These studies show that CO2 photoreduction productions are influenced by the presence of carbon deposits (i.e. organic molecules, carbonates and bicarbonates) over the TiO2 surface. Most importantly, the acid\/base character of the surface and the reaction medium play a key role in the selectivity and deactivation pathways.

In addition, the Schottky junction formed between the SrTiO3 and cocatalysts enabled the rapid transfer of photoexcited electrons from SrTiO3 to the cocatalysts, resulting in effective separation and prolonged photoexcited electron lifetimes. The electron migration route between SrTiO3 and the cocatalysts was determined by in situ irradiation X-ray spectroscopy, and band structures of SrTiO3 and the cocatalysts are proposed based on results obtained from UV-vis diffraction reflection spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. On the basis of our results, the dual cocatalysts unambiguously boosts charge separation and enhances photocatalytic performance. In summary, we have investigated the flux of photoexcited electrons in a dual cocatalysts system and provided a theoretical basis and ideas for subsequent research.""","""Li Wang,Yukun Li,Chao Wu,Xin Li,Guosheng Shao,Peng Zhang""",43,zhangp@zzu.edu.cn,"""CN,CN,CN,CN,CN,CN""",

Nevertheless, the poor stability of MHP nanocrystals (NCs) in water-contained system, especially without the protection of long alkyl chain ligands, severely restricts their photocatalytic performance. In this context, we report an effortless strategy for the generation of ligand-free MHP NCs based photocatalyst with high water tolerance, by coating PbI2 on the surface of ligand-free formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) NCs via the facile procedure of in-situ conversion with the aid of ZnI2. Under the protection of PbI2 layer, the resultant FAPbBr3\/PbI2 composite exhibits significantly ameliorated stability in an artificial photosynthesis system with CO2 and H2O vapor as feedstocks. Moreover, the formation of compact PbI2 layer can accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers in FAPbBr3 NCs, bringing forth a remarkable improvement of CO2 photoreduction efficiency with an impressive electron consumption yield of 2053 \u00b5mol\/g in the absence of organic sacrificial agents, which is 7-fold over that of pristine FAPbBr3 NCs.""","""Ning-Na Guoa,Zhao-Lei Liua,Yan-Fei Mua,Yuan Yao,Meng-Ran Zhanga,Min Zhanga,Tong-Bu Lu""",33,yyuan@hit.edu.cn,"""CN,CN,CN,CN,CN,CN,CN""",

The In intercalation into 2D ZrSe2 nanostructures helped for the nucleation process along with cationic stability and improved crystallinity as well as morphology. The InZrSe2 microflowers have optimized bandgap value i.e., 1.65 eV and showed good photocatalytic CO2 conversion to methanol and methane through hydrogenation. The results showed satisfied selectivity for methanol (87%) during CO2 photoconversion with production rate up to 740.574\u00b5molg-1h\u22121 and rate of methane hydrogenation (54% selectivity) to be 10.12\u00b5molg-1h\u22121.
